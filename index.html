<p> <span class="leader">Josef Müller-Brockmann</span> is a Swizz born graphic artist and a participant of the 'Swiss international style'. In his school years his love for graphic design became quickly apparent after discovering his artistic ingenuity by accident after an impressed teacher consulted him about his skills. He would go on to explore this field with him becoming an apprentice as a retoucher in a printing house. Although, for only one day as it didn't meet his artistic expectiations.  </p>
<br><br>
<p>Brockmann then went to varios graphic designers to see where they studied, leading him to enroll at the highly prestiege <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d5402.206189109001!2d8.51149961098342!3d47.390421331045474!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x47900a0dbe5a823f%3A0x8fed983c8d9df33c!2sZurich%20University%20of%20the%20Arts!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1607651144066!5m2!1sen!2suk" target="_blank" title="Direct to Location">Zurich School of Arts and Crafts</a>. As Josef wasn’t much of a writer, with his talent being more in the visual area, he then went on to study graphic design and architecture.</p>
<br><br>

<p>By 1934 he opened his own graphic & illustration studio in Zurich. In 1937, he became a member of the Swiss Werkbund. Focusing his work more on illustration and exhibition design, in 1950 he designed his first poster for the Tonhalle in Zurich for a concert being held. At this time Josef developed an interest in constructivism and using it in his art. Eventually, he was influenced by the ideas of major different design and art movements at that time including De Stijl, Suprematism, constructivism and the Bauhaus. Joseph Müller-Brockmann, the Swiss graphic designer created a universal graphic expression employing a grid-based design exclusive of subjective feeling and extraneous illustration.</p>

<p>Brockman theorized that his work is of mental unconsciouness. In an <a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-josef-muller-brockmann" target="_blank" title="Direct to Interview">eyemagazine interview</a>, he explains,<blockquote> <span class="bigquote">"</span> The unconscious is part of the support structure. Everything that is stored there comes to light in the work process. What I try to achieve in my work is to communicate information about an idea, event or product as clearly as possible. <span class="bigquote">" </span> </blockquote> 

<p>He communicated information about an idea, event or product as vividly as possible to retain a sense of ones own neutral interperation of the subject. 
</p>
<br><br>
<p> In fact, he mentions that his work is not intended to make a timeless statement rather to invite his audience to form their own opinion on the subject being visually presented. The style, shapes and colours which he incorporated into his work still holds relevancy in today’s age inspiring many people of this current generation. </p>

<p>Josef Brockmann would go on to write books such as ‘Gestaltungsprobleme des Grafikers’, 1961, which translates to “Design problems with artistic design”. In this book he would do exactly that by solving the problem of finding the appropriate contemporary form. In his book he would talk about the method, meaning and effect of his illustrative work in the advertising industry, such as brochures, posters, exhibitions, etc. In the last section of his book the systematic education of the graphic designer is presented by a means of comprehensive documentation. This created a new standard of work that still serves as an historic practical guide globally even to this day, allowing graphic designers a valuable survey of the fundamental tasks of design.</p>
